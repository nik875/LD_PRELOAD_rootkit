Defensive LD_PRELOAD rootkit that conceals wazuh-agent and silently monitors unauthorized filesystem alterations from inside attacker-controlled processes. Main priority is stealth. Upon attempted access of rootkit files or /etc/ld.so.preload, "apoptosis" is triggered and both the rootkit and wazuh-agent are cleanly deleted. It's more important to conceal the fact that we've done this than fight red team; the incident reports should reveal what process triggered the Cytochrome C tripwire and help a human admin identify red team's persistence and C2.
